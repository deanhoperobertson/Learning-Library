    "Before we get started with the code in this module, let's go through quickly go through the theory behind regularization.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If you covered the previous module on [Linear Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSKzqb0EKS0), you will remember that we performed manual variable selection to improve the predictive accuracy of our model. This process of variable selection is discrete in that we will either keep a variable, or we will throw it away.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization offers an alternative method in which all predictor variables are included, but are subject to constraint. You will (hopefully) remember from the previous module that the least squares method seeks to minimise the sum of the squares of the residuals.\n",

    "$\\alpha$ above is a tuning parameter (which we'll need to determine - more on this later) which affects how much the regression coefficients are penalised. The effect of this penalty parameter is that it creates a tradeoff between a coefficient's contribution to minimizing RSS and its size, i.e. **training fit** vs **size of coefficients**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the equation above, we can see that the penalty parameter is applied to the sum of the squares of the coefficients.

    "Because we standardized the features, we interpret the intercept slightly differently than in the case of multiple variable linear regression. Previously it was the expected Dollar/Rand exchange rate when all feature values are set to zero. Now, since the standardized features are all centered around zero, the intercept can be interpreted as the expected exchange rate when all the features are equal to their means.   \n",

Previously (without standardization) it was the expected change in exchange rate given an increase of 1 unit in the feature value. Now (with standardization) it is the expected change in exchange rate given an increase of 1 in the **scaled feature value**.\n",
